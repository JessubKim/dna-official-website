# Participant Agreement

<hr class="dashed">


***Acknowledgement of country***<br>
We meet on the lands of the Wurundjeri Woi-wurrung people and acknowledge sovereignty over this land was never ceded. We acknowledge the centuries of resistance that indigenous people have led against unsustainable and inhumane practices of capitalist colonisation. We learn from indigenous knowledge systems that have embodied many of the degrowth values for countless generations.</p>

***Step up Step Back***<br>
If you find yourself speaking a lot at meetings try to ‘step back’ and make space for others to speak. Likewise, if you find that you don’t speak very much, try to ‘step up’ and speak up when you have thoughts/feelings about a topic.

***Respect differences***<br>
Be aware that people in the group come from different perspectives and lived experiences; try to understand and respect these differences.


***Respectful of self-expression***<br>
Allow and encourage people to explain how they came to their opinion and express themselves. Let others finish their point before interjecting


***Active listening***<br>
Engage and listen respectfully even when not actively involved in the discussion.


***Awareness of time constraints***<br>
Be aware of limited timeframes. It is equally the facilitator's and group's responsibility to manage time spent on topics.


***Facilitator and organiser help***<br>
These gatherings only happen when people put in the time and effort to make them happen. All are welcome to have a turn facilitating and organising the gatherings, and can be supported by those with more experience. At the end of each gathering we will check in to see who is happy to organise the next one.


***Accountability and sustaining ourselves***<br>
We try our best to follow through with things we have said we could do, and communicate to those affected when we can't . We recognise we need to look after ourselves to be effective agents of change.
